# 🔒 Lab 04 – Offline Password Cracking

---

## 📘 Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates how weakly secured cookies can lead to offline password cracking and account takeover. The challenge combines two vulnerabilities: insecure cookie design and stored XSS. Your goal is to steal Carlos’s stay-logged-in cookie, crack his password hash offline, and use it to log in and delete his account.
